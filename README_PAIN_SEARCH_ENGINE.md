## Data Sources

### Reddit Integration
- Searches across all subreddits using PRAW
- Extracts post titles, content, and comments
- Caches results for 1 hour
- Configurable post limits and subreddit targeting

### News API Integration
- Uses your News API key for article search
- Searches for pain-related keywords
- Filters by language and date range
- Caches results for 30 minutes

### Stack Overflow Integration
- Uses Stack Exchange API
- Searches for technical problems
- Configurable page limits and sorting

### ComplaintsBoard Integration
- Web scraping with Selenium
- Extracts customer complaints
- Handles pagination and rate limiting

## AI Analysis

The system uses Groq AI (with OpenRouter fallback) to:

1. **Extract Pain Points**: Identify specific problems from source data
2. **Generate Opportunities**: Suggest startup ideas based on pain points
3. **Score Severity**: Rate problems from 1-10
4. **Segment Users**: Identify affected user groups
5. **Analyze Trends**: Determine frequency and urgency

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Flask application running
- Required API keys (see below)

### Environment Variables
```bash
# News API
NEWS_API_KEY=your_news_api_key

# Reddit API
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_reddit_client_id
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_reddit_client_secret
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=your_user_agent

# Groq AI
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
GROQ_API_KEY_1=your_groq_api_key_1
# ... (up to GROQ_API_KEY_29 for rotation)

# OpenRouter (fallback)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
```

### Installation
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up your environment variables in `.env` file

3. Start the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Access the Pain Search Engine at:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000/pain-search-engine
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Search
1. Navigate to the Pain Search Engine page
2. Enter your search query (e.g., "project management", "customer service")
3. Select a category (optional)
4. Click "Search"
5. Review pain points and startup opportunities

### Advanced Features
- **Category Filtering**: Filter results by industry/domain
- **Source Tabs**: View raw data from each source
- **Severity Analysis**: Focus on high-severity pain points
- **Opportunity Validation**: Review startup idea scores

## Technical Details

### Caching
- Reddit results: 1 hour
- News API results: 30 minutes
- Stack Overflow results: 1 hour
- ComplaintsBoard results: 1 hour

### Rate Limiting
- Concurrent requests limited to 4 workers
- 30-second timeout per source
- Automatic fallback for failed sources

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when sources fail
- Fallback AI responses when Groq/OpenRouter unavailable
- User-friendly error messages

## Customization

### Adding New Sources
1. Create a new search function
2. Add it to the ThreadPoolExecutor in `/api/pain-search`
3. Update the results processing logic
4. Add source tab in the frontend

### Modifying AI Analysis
1. Update the `analysis_prompt` in the API endpoint
2. Adjust JSON structure for pain points and opportunities
3. Modify severity scoring logic

### Styling
The interface uses Bootstrap 5 and custom CSS. Modify `templates/pain_search_engine.html` for styling changes.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No results found"**
- Check API keys are configured
- Verify network connectivity
- Review source-specific error logs

**"AI analysis failed"**
- Check Groq API key and quota
- Verify OpenRouter fallback is configured
- Review prompt length limits

**"Slow performance"**
- Reduce concurrent workers
- Increase cache duration
- Optimize search queries

### Debug Mode
Enable Flask debug mode for detailed error messages:
```python
app.run(debug=True)
```
